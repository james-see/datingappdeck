# datingappdeck

Dan Golman is building a new dating experience.

Free for all and centered around doing something while getting to know another human.

This is the deck with the demo walk through. To compile locally:

1. gem install mdslide
2. mdslide -i deck.md

## deploy deck yourself

1. gem install mdslide
2. mdslide -i deck.md -o index.html

This will generate all the js and css you need and you can run the `http-server` from npm locally there or you can deploy anywhere for statically hosted deck.
